# Bad_OS
Operating system written as a 10th grade project to hone C and Assembler skills. It's cranky and mono-core, but it still works. I plan to make it possible to connect external media. Inside: command line interface as a separate program, file system, API, simple game, simple text editor, half-written assembler compiler. All API and commands will be attached in a separate documentation file later.
